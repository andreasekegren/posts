title: How I Got the Most out of Attending WWDC (and You Can Too)
---

WWDC is the highlight of the year for developers and fans of Apple’s platforms. Attending the conference is a great opportunity for learning about the latest Apple tech, meeting some really awesome people and getting inspired. Having attended a few times, I want to share some of my experiences and the things I picked up that make for a great WWDC week.


### Preparations

Book your hotel as soon as the conference dates are announced. Don’t wait until you know that you actually have won a conference ticket. Most online booking services such as hotels.com offer a full refund as long as you cancel more than 24 hours before the check-in date, so there’s no risk in case you don’t win. Whether you intend to stay at a hotel or an Airbnb apartment you’ll find that your options are narrowing and prices are going up quickly once ticket winners are announced. Living in San Francisco is incredibly expensive and during WWDC it really gets crazy.

Booking your flight is a bit less urgent and you will naturally want to wait until you have a WWDC ticket before you book it. With both SFO and Oakland airports being good options you shouldn’t have any problems finding reasonable airfare though.

Next thing is to make sure you have a valid credit card with sufficent funds associated with the Apple ID you applied with. Confirm this even before you enter the WWDC ticket lottery. If you win but the charge for the ticket doesn’t go through you will have forsaken your chance and some other lucky person will get your ticket instead.


###### Hooray! This is the email you want to see in your inbox.
Once you’ve hopefully won a ticket you should download the official WWDC app. Don’t forget to log in with the Apple ID holding the conference ticket. Once you’ve done that you can add your WWDC ticket to the Wallet app on your iPhone.

Find other events you want to attend. San Francisco is chock full of great meet-ups and lots of parties hosted by all the big tech companies during the WWDC week. Book your tickets and RSVP as soon as possible since most will probably be full by the time you arrive. WWDC Parties is a good place to see what’s going on.

Get the WWDC.family app – this allows you to easily meet up with other developers who are in town for the conference once you’re there. The app lets everyone who has opted in to display their profile and current location on a map.

Pack your test devices. Depending on which of Apple’s platforms you’re interested in you’ll want to pack one or more. Make sure that the devices your bring are reasonably new models as to minimize the chance that they will be deprecated by the new OS releases.

Make sure to prepare any design or code that you want to run by Apple’s designers and engineers in the labs. Time flies very quickly in the lab so you don’t want to waste it by trying to find some file or fixing some last minute bug that prevents your app from running once you’re there.

### The days before

Fly in early. Arrive no later than the Saturday before the keynote (which is always on a Monday) to have time to settle in, get out, and collect your conference badge. Don’t be in a rush to adapt your sleep cycle if you’re jet lagged though – that jet lag will actually work to your benefit on keynote day (you’ll see why soon).

Do a road trip. Just an hour south of San Francisco you’ll find legendary places like Cupertino (Apple HQ), Mountain View (Google) and Stanford University. Make sure to take the scenic route if you have the time.


Road trip! Naturally we ended up with an electric prototype car since this is Silicon Valley.
Go on the unofficial WWDC hike that’s arranged by iOS developer Sam Soffes. You’ll spend a lot of the upcoming week sitting still so you won’t regret stretching your legs a bit before. Also, the views along the hike are truly amazing and you will be in the company of other friendly WWDC attendees.

Don’t lose the badge! Apple won’t replace it and without it you won’t be getting in.
The day before the keynote (typically a Sunday) Apple opens up the WWDC registration where you collect your badge. You can get it the same morning as the keynote, but don’t. Trying to get a good seat for the presentation can be stressful enough as it is. Also, the checkin doesn’t open until 7 AM, which means you can’t get in line until after that if you do it the same day.

### Keynote day

Arrive early. I’m not kidding. EARLY. The truest of the believers get in line the day before. If you want a good seat fairly close to the stage you’ll probably want to arrive by 3–4 AM even though the keynote doesn’t start until 10 AM. This might sound like a chore but the line is actually a lot of fun – everyone is happy to be there and open to meeting new people.

The line to get into the WWDC keynote.
Once you’re seated it’s not long until showtime. Watching an Apple keynote in person is a mesmerizing experience. Not just because of all the new stuff that’s presented but also because the production values of the keynote are simply the best in the business. It’s an incredible performance and when you’re there you can feel the energy of the crowd as it reacts to the announcements.

###### The keynote
While the focus is on the keynote it’s not the only event of the day. After the lunch break there’s the State of the Union talk that dives into the technical details of what was presented during the keynote and finally there’s the Apple Design Awards where exemplary apps and their developers are honored. It’s always interesting to hear Apple’s motivations for the winners they picked.

The conference schedule is publicized during the keynote day. Once you’re back at your room, resting after an early morning and a full day, it’s a great time to go through the schedule in the WWDC app and favorite the events you think you’ll want to attend in order to create your own personal schedule for the week.

### Conference week

By now you should have a pretty good idea of what topics you want to focus on and what events you want to attend. Some prefer the sessions (presentations) whereas others find the hands-on labs with Apple engineers the most useful. Don’t worry in case there’s an overlap in your schedule – all sessions are recorded and available to view afterwards.


Moscone West, the location of the WWDC sessions and labs.
One of the most coveted labs at WWDC is the UI Design Lab, where you have the chance to sit down one-on-one with an Apple UI designer to get feedback and ideas on your app design. This is popular for a reason, since it’s a rare opportunity to get not only really good input but also an idea of how Apple as an institution regards design in general and yours in particular. If you have any ambition to be featured in the App Store or win one of those Design Awards then this lab is a no-brainer. I’ve used it for apps that I was working on and got some great constructive critique. It used to be that attending this lab meant getting up really early and waiting in line again (in addition to the keynote), but starting with 2016 this is no longer necessary since an online reservation form is now used instead. The reservations opens up the same morning as the day of lab, so you’ll still want to wake up early.

Besides attending the official events the days at Moscone are spent eating, hanging out, mingling and coding. The drink and snack selection is pretty good, but the complementary box lunches served all week are a WWDC in-joke. Expect to eat a lot of bread, bagels and pastries. The Odwalla drinks, on the other hand, are great!

During the week you’ll be around a lot of cool people. Don’t hesitate to reach out! The atmosphere at WWDC is incredibly friendly and open. Make sure to add interesting people that you talk to on Twitter or such so you can stay in touch. All in all it’s a great place to make new friends and business relationships.

The conference schedule usually ends at 6 pm, but that doesn’t mean that the day does. The evenings during WWDC offer a variety of related things to do and events to attend across the city. Some of my best WWDC memories are from events outside of the actual conference, such as the live recording of The Talk Show with John Gruber of Daring Fireball. It took place in an open bar and had none other than Apple Senior Vice Presidents Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi as surprise guests, giving the crowd an unprecedented view into Apple (did I mention that the beer was free?).

### The Bash

On Thursday, the day before the last conference day, Apple hosts a WWDC bash. This is an 18 and above only party with free drinks and artists performing live. Don’t expect Rihanna or Coldplay, but there’s usually a fairly well-known band playing. Definitely worth attending.

### Safety

San Francisco isn’t any different than other major cities – common sense and some knowledge of the city is enough to keep you safe. I’d suggest avoiding walking through the Tenderloin district. Also, avoid broadcasting that you’re a developer loaded with Apple gear by not wearing the conference badge out on the street (you actually see a lot of attendees do that).

### Before flying home

Download all the new goodies – betas of the new OS versions, SDKs etc – and install them on your test devices. If you missed out on any of the sessions that you wanted to see then make sure to download the video recordings. Depending on how long your flight home is you’ll have ample time in peace to catch up on anything you missed and play around with all the new stuff.
